Introduction
============

_The aim of this project is to create an ANSI C90 compiler that will both parse to python3 and generate assembly code in MIPS32_

There are many things to do:
- [x] Lexer
- [x] AST
- [ ] Support for register spilling
- [x] Codegen
- [x] Integer
- [x] Global variables
- [x] Function Calls
- [x] Prototype Function Calls
- [ ] String
- [x] Return
- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Pointers
- [x] Types of Constants
- [ ] Argc Argv
- [x] if-Else
- [ ] Switch
- [x] conditional statements
- [x] Conditional Expression Short Circuiting
- [x] Support Excessive Brackets!!

No complete double interpretation but it can do most operations!
Currently supports ints, float and (double kindof?)
